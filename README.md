# M Non-Attacking Queens on an N-Triangle

This project places **M** queens on an **N-sized triangular board** such that no two queens attack each other.  
Includes both **brute-force** and **efficient** solving methods.

## Efficient Methods

Two known approaches beyond brute-force:
- Diagonal based placement
- Column based placement
